# Last Turn:
Consider a game board consisting of 6x6 cells, each of which can contain a symbol representing a player (an X or an O). The board is initially empty. 
Players move in turn. In a move, a player must choose an empty cell and write his or her symbol (an X or an O, respectively) into it and all of its neighbouring empty cells 
(consider the cells that are to the left, right, top, bottom of the chosen cell). Thus, when the chosen cell has 4 empty neighbouring empty cells, the symbols of the player
form a + symbol. The winner of the game is the player who makes the last move.
